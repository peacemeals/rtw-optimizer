## How to Use This Guide

This guide distills the collective wisdom of hundreds of experienced RTW travelers into actionable tips. Each tip is rated by relevance to our specific V3 routing (CAI→AMM→DOH→NRT..HND→TSA..TPE→HKG→SIN→NAN→FUN→NAN→SFO→JFK→[MCO]→MIA→MEX→MAD→CAI). Tips marked with **[V3]** have direct application to our itinerary.

## 1. Booking Strategy

### 1.1 Who to Call

| Channel | Quality | Best For | Avoid For |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **AA RTW desk** | Gold standard | Complex routings, changes, codeshare flexibility | — |
| **Travel agent (Amadeus GDS)** | Excellent | QR-plated tickets (saves EUR 800+), 24/7 support | Agents unfamiliar with RTW |
| **JL RTW team** | Good | Ex-Japan bookings | — |
| **CX** | Good | HKG-based travelers | — |
| **QR direct** | Not possible | — | RTW bookings (QR has no RTW desk, redirects to website) |
| **QF** | Poor | — | Everything (10+ calls for changes, "hopeless" post-COVID agents) |
| **BA** | Poor | — | Modifications (email-only changes, weeks of delays) |
| **Online tool** | Worst | Quick initial pricing estimate only | Actual booking (buggy, defaults to QF ticketing) |

**AA RTW desk contacts:**
- US toll-free: **1-800-247-3247**
- International: **+1 817-267-1151**
- Hours: Mon-Fri 0700-2230 CT, Sat-Sun 0700-2000 CT
- Budget **30-60 minutes per call** (systems are slow)
- Use Skype for free international calls to US toll-free numbers

**[V3]** Book through AA RTW desk. If exploring QR plating for YQ savings, use a travel agent who can issue on QR ticket stock (e.g., dutch_122's TA at e-Businesstravel Netherlands, EUR 75 fee — issued 7 QR-plated RTW tickets in one month).

### 1.2 How to Book (The Segment-by-Segment Method)

This is the single most important booking technique, recommended by Dr. HFH (who books "two or three RTW per year for a decade"):

1. **Feed the agent ONE flight at a time.** Do not present the full itinerary upfront.
2. **Wait for D-class confirmation** before moving to the next segment.
3. **Ensure 4+ hour gaps on AA domestic connections** — shorter gaps trigger automatic "marriage" (segments become linked and inflexible).
4. **Build 24+ hour gaps on international connections** — this creates stopovers (not transits) and prevents married-segment issues.
5. **Never present two segments as a "connection"** — this invites married-segment restrictions that can block D-class availability.

**Why this matters:** Married segments are the #1 cause of phantom D-class — ExpertFlyer shows availability, but the booking system can't actually grab it because the segments are bundled. Booking one at a time prevents this.

**[V3]** Our AA domestic chain MCO→MIA→MEX has a ~2h45m connection at MIA. This is under 4 hours and will likely be auto-married. Book MCO→MIA and MIA→MEX as separate requests. If D-class vanishes when married, ask the agent to build a 4+ hour gap or overnight in Miami.

### 1.3 Dummy Dates Strategy

**Rule**: Date-only changes (same airports, same carriers) are **always free**. Only routing/airport changes cost $125.

**Strategy:**
1. Book the first 4-6 segments with confirmed dates.
2. Book remaining segments with **placeholder dates** (any dates that produce valid routing).
3. Change to actual dates later — **free of charge**.
4. Dummy dates should reflect your actual transit/stopover pattern (connections under 24h, stopovers over 24h) so tax calculations are accurate from the start.

**Extended booking technique**: AA's SABRE system books only 330 days out. For segments beyond this window:
- Book with dummy dates within the 330-day window
- Change to actual dates when the calendar opens
- Or use open-dated segments (Rule 3015 5(a): "Subsequent segments may be open-dated")

**[V3]** For booking ~13 months before Mar 10, 2026 departure, the last 3-4 segments (MEX→MAD→CAI and possibly MCO→MIA→MEX) may fall outside the 330-day window. Use dummy dates and change later for free.

### 1.4 Consolidate Changes

- **$125 fee is per PERSON, not per transaction.** For 2 travelers, any routing change = $250 total.
- **Consolidate multiple routing changes into ONE call.** All simultaneous changes = one $125 fee per person.
- **Date changes remain free** regardless of how many are changed at once.

**[V3]** If FJ schedule verification forces date shifts across multiple segments, make all date changes in a single call. Since date changes are free, there's no financial penalty. If any routing changes are needed (e.g., dropping a segment), batch them into one call to pay only one $125 fee.

## 2. Pricing Optimization

### 2.1 Plating/Issuing Carrier — The Biggest Cost Lever

The airline that "plates" (issues) the ticket determines the carrier-imposed charges (YQ/YR) across the ENTIRE itinerary. Same routing, different plating carrier:

| Plating Carrier | Approx. Taxes (same routing) | Savings vs AA/BA |
|----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| **QR (Qatar)** | EUR 1,985 | **EUR 1,273 cheaper** |
| **MH (Malaysia)** | ~EUR 2,050 | ~EUR 1,200 cheaper |
| **CX (Cathay)** | EUR 3,150 | ~EUR 100 cheaper |
| **AA or BA** | EUR 3,258 | Baseline (most expensive) |

*Source: dutch_122, comparing identical DONE4 routing ex-OSL.*

**QR plating saves ~EUR 800-1,273** but QR has no RTW desk. Solution: use a travel agent who can plate on QR ticket stock.

**Trade-off**: AA plating gives best customer service for mid-trip changes. QR plating gives cheapest ticket but changes must go through the TA.

**[V3]** With 16/16 segments and 3 FJ frequency constraints, mid-trip changes are likely. **AA plating is recommended for flexibility** despite higher YQ. If cost minimization is paramount, investigate QR plating via TA — but accept reduced change flexibility.

### 2.2 Carrier Surcharge Hierarchy

From cheapest to most expensive YQ/YR per segment:

| Carrier | YQ Level | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **LAN/LATAM** | Zero | No YQ at all (historical) |
| **AY (Finnair)** | Zero/Very low | Historically zero, small amounts recently |
| **JL (JAL)** | Very low | ~AUD 12 per segment |
| **AA** | Low-Moderate | Only charges on own long-haul marketed segments |
| **RJ** | Moderate | ~AUD 170 |
| **CX** | Moderate | ~AUD 200 |
| **IB** | High | ~AUD 220 |
| **BA** | Highest | ~AUD 321 |
| **QF** | Highest | ~AUD 334 |

*Source: pandaperth comparison, ex-LHR.*

**AA as ticketing carrier advantage**: AA charges YQ ONLY on its own marketed long-haul segments. Partner segments carry NO additional AA-imposed YQ. This means our QR, CX, FJ, and RJ segments would have minimal surcharges under AA ticketing.

**[V3]** Our main surcharge exposure is on the IB segments (MEX→MAD, MAD→CAI). IB has high surcharges (~AUD 220). AA domestic segments (SFO→JFK, MCO→MIA, MIA→MEX) should have low or zero YQ under AA ticketing.

### 2.3 QR YQ Structure

Qatar charges YQ differently from other carriers:
- **Flat charge on the first QR segment**, then small incremental amounts for each additional QR segment.
- Adding more QR-coded segments has diminishing YQ cost.
- Breaking a single long QR segment into two shorter ones (adding a stopover) can reduce QR YQ.

**[V3]** Our routing has 2 QR segments (AMM→DOH, DOH→NRT). The first inter-TC sector is QR-coded (DOH→NRT, TC2→TC3) — this is already optimal for QR YQ minimization.

### 2.4 UK Departure Tax Trap

**Zero charges to land in the UK, but significant charges to leave** — especially for premium cabin long-haul departures (~GBP 250).

**Strategy**: Fly INTO the UK; depart from somewhere else.

**[V3]** Our IB routing (MEX→MAD→CAI) **avoids the UK entirely** — no UK departure tax. This is one of the cost advantages of the IB routing over the BA alternative (MEX→LHR→CAI), which would have incurred UK departure tax on LHR→CAI.

### 2.5 Base Fare Lock — The Golden Rule

> "Fly the first segment. That locks the fare."

- **Before first flight**: Any change to ticketed points OR first segment can trigger full repricing at current (potentially much higher) fares.
- **After first flight**: Base fare is permanently locked. Routing changes only incur $125 fee + tax recalculation. No base fare increase possible.

**This is the single most critical operational insight for ex-Cairo bookings.** Egyptian pound devaluation has historically caused dramatic fare increases. If you book at a favorable rate, **fly CAI→AMM immediately** to lock that fare forever.

**[V3]** Our first segment is CAI→AMM on Mar 10. Once this flight is taken, the DONE4 base fare is locked for the rest of the ticket. If any scheduling issues arise, resolve them AFTER flying the first segment, not before.

### 2.6 First-Segment Date Change Warning

Changing the date of the **first segment** (even a date-only change, no routing change) before departure can trigger repricing if fares have increased. One FT user faced a **$6,000+ increase** from this.

This risk applies ONLY to the first segment. Subsequent segment date changes are safe.

**[V3]** Do NOT change the CAI→AMM date after booking. Set it and fly it. If schedule conflicts arise, resolve them on later segments (where date changes are free and risk-free).

---

## 3. Availability & D-Class Tips

### 3.1 Point of Sale (POS) Controls Everything

Availability for the **entire** RTW ticket is governed by the POS — the departure city of the first segment. This means:
- What D-class inventory you see from ExpertFlyer (which defaults to US POS) may differ from what's available from a CAI POS.
- The online tool may show per-leg availability, but this is misleading. The AA RTW desk books with the correct POS.

**[V3]** Our POS is Cairo (CAI). Ask the AA desk to confirm D-class availability from CAI POS, not per-leg. If ExpertFlyer shows D-class but the desk can't see it, POS restrictions may be the cause.

### 3.2 ExpertFlyer Is Not Definitive

ExpertFlyer is useful for initial research but has critical limitations:
- Does NOT show Point of Origin (POO) restrictions
- Married-segment logic can block availability that appears open
- Carrier restrictions on D-class release to specific booking channels are invisible
- POS setting affects what appears

**Workaround**: Confirm availability by calling the operating carrier directly (especially for QR and FJ).

### 3.3 Married Segment Avoidance

| Carrier | Marriage Threshold | Strategy |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| AA domestic | 4 hours | Build 4+ hour gaps between AA domestic segments |
| Most international | 24 hours | Build 24+ hour stopovers between international segments |

**Breaking married segments can backfire**: D-class may only exist on married (bundled) segments. Splitting them into point-to-point bookings can cause D-class to disappear entirely.

**[V3]** Our MCO→MIA→MEX chain has a ~2h45m MIA connection — this will be auto-married by AA's system. Options:
1. Accept the marriage (if D-class is available on the married pair, this is fine)
2. Overnight in Miami (creates a stopover, breaks the marriage, but uses more time)
3. Book MCO→MIA separately and accept whatever happens

### 3.4 D-Class Scarcity by Carrier

| Carrier | D-Class Availability | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| QR | Good (long-haul) | DOH-NRT usually has D; QR stingy closer to departure |
| CX | Moderate | A350 routes generally better; regional routes tight |
| FJ | Moderate-Good | Good on US routes (NAN→SFO/LAX/DFW); SIN→NAN may be tight |
| AA | Good (domestic) | TransCon A321T usually available; SFO-JFK is premium route |
| JL | Moderate | A350 routes restricted; 787-9 generally available |
| IB | Good | Multiple daily MEX→MAD flights; A350 routes typically open |
| QF | **Poor** | "Notoriously stingy" — over 30 J seats on 787 but D rarely released |
| RJ | Good | Small airline, usually accommodating |
| AS | **Erratic** | Randomly available/unavailable; mainly 737s |

**[V3]** Our routing avoids QF entirely (no Australian segments). Potential D-class pinch points: FJ SIN→NAN (1-2x/week, limited capacity), CX TPE→HKG (fleet lottery), JL HND→TSA (verify early).

## 4. Rule Mastery

### 4.1 The Rules That Actually Matter

| Rule | What It Says | Common Misunderstanding |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| **16 segments** | Maximum 16 (flight + surface) | Surface sectors count too |
| **4 per continent** | 4 flights per continent (6 in NA) | Transits count as segments, not just stopovers |
| **2 stopovers in origin continent** | Maximum 2 stopovers in your continent of origin | Transits (<24h) don't count as stopovers |
| **Hawaii backtracking** | Cannot go mainland→Hawaii on-ticket | Only backtracking restriction in the entire rules |
| **One transcon** | One nonstop between Column A/B states | Defined by specific state groups, not colloquial "coast to coast" |
| **QR not first** | QR cannot be the first carrier | Book via AA desk or TA; RJ/CX/BA can be first |
| **Circle the globe** | Must cross both Atlantic and Pacific | Surface crossings not permitted (exception: SWP origin) |
| **One year validity** | First to last flight departure within 12 months | Departure date controls, not arrival |
| **Direction** | Must visit all 3 TCs in continuous forward direction | Eastbound or westbound, but no reversals |
| **No mileage cap** | oneworld Explorer has NO distance limit | The 34,000nm cap is Global Explorer only |
| **Same-city = one stop** | NRT/HND both = "Tokyo"; TSA/TPE both = "Taipei" | Same-city transfers are NOT surface sectors |

### 4.2 Rules That Are Soft (Agent-Dependent)

Some restrictions documented in the User Guide are NOT always enforced:

- **Transit through origin city**: One user successfully transited through Tokyo on segment #12 despite starting in Tokyo. AA desk booked and rebooked without objection. However, "getting lucky doesn't negate the rules" — don't count on this.
- **Agent-invented restrictions**: Some agents claim restrictions not in the published fare rules (e.g., "no two visits to Asia if originating in Asia"). Quote Rule 3015 directly if challenged.
- **Online tool errors**: The tool invents restrictions like "maximum 5 stopovers for itineraries under 26,000 miles" — this rule does NOT exist.

**[V3]** Our routing is fully rules-compliant (verified against Rule 3015). If an agent challenges any aspect, reference the specific fare rule section.

### 4.3 Surface Sectors — What Counts

- Surface sectors count toward the 16-segment maximum
- Surface sectors do NOT count as stopovers
- Multi-airport same-city surfaces (NRT→HND, TSA→TPE) are treated as same-city — NOT surface sectors
- Allowed within: same country, Middle East, US-Canada, HKG-China, MY-SG, Africa, Maldives-Sri Lanka/India

**[V3]** Our routing has one surface sector: JFK→MCO. This counts as segment #12 of 16. The NRT→HND and TSA→TPE same-city transfers should NOT generate surface sectors — but MUST be confirmed with the booking agent. If the GDS creates them as surface sectors, Asia would show 6/4 segments (over limit).

### 4.4 The Africa Rule

**Rule 4(e): Only ONE visit to Africa permitted on any itinerary.** Europe-origin travelers have been denied returning to Europe after visiting Africa.

**[V3]** Our routing does not visit Africa. Egypt is classified as Middle East (EU/ME), not Africa. No issue.

### 4.5 Continent of Origin Stopover Limit

**Maximum 2 stopovers in continent of origin.** Our origin continent is EU/ME (Cairo = Middle East zone).

**[V3]** Our EU/ME stopovers: AMM (stopover) + DOH (stopover) = 2/2. The MAD stop is also EU/ME — **but wait**: MAD→CAI is the final leg returning to origin, which is always permitted. However, if MAD is classified as a 3rd EU/ME stopover, this could be a problem. Verify with booking agent whether the return journey's intermediate stops count against the 2-stopover limit. If MAD counts, we'd need to make it a transit (<24h connection) rather than a 2-night stopover.

**UPDATE**: The 2-stopover limit applies to stopovers, not segments. Our 4 EU/ME segments are: CAI→AMM, AMM→DOH, MEX→MAD, MAD→CAI. The stopovers are AMM, DOH, and MAD. That's **3 stopovers in EU/ME**, which would violate the 2-stopover limit. **Resolution options:**
1. Make Madrid a transit: Arrive MEX→MAD morning, depart MAD→CAI same day or within 24h. Loses the 2-night Madrid stopover.
2. Revert to BA routing: MEX→LHR→CAI. London is EU/ME but is also the origin area, potentially treated differently.
3. Confirm with AA desk: The return-to-origin leg may be exempt from stopover counting in practice.

**This is a critical question to resolve with the AA RTW desk before booking.**

## 5. Mid-Trip Management

### 5.1 Have a 24/7 Travel Agent Backup

Airport check-in agents today "lack ticketing expertise" — they can check you in but cannot reticket or modify RTW bookings. If something goes wrong mid-trip (schedule change, missed connection, IRROPS), you need a specialist.

**Options:**
- AA RTW desk (Mon-Fri 0700-2230 CT, weekends 0700-2000 CT) — not 24/7
- Specialist TA with 24/7 Amadeus access (e.g., dutch_122's TA: EUR 25-50 per after-hours call)
- AA general line for urgent rebooking (less specialized but 24/7)

**[V3]** Our trip crosses multiple time zones. AA desk closes at 22:30 CT — that's 04:30 London, 05:30 Cairo, 06:30 Amman, 07:30 DOH, 13:30 Tokyo, 14:30 Taipei, 14:30 HKG, 14:30 SIN, 10:30 next day Fiji. Most of our Asian segments depart during AA desk hours. The Fiji and Pacific segments are the gap — have TA backup for Apr 2-15.

### 5.2 Monitor Your Itinerary Actively

Airlines change schedules without notification. One FT user's Alaska Airlines flight was changed by **3 minutes** and AA failed to automatically reticket.

**Checklist:**
- Check your full itinerary on AA.com weekly during the trip
- Set up TripIt/TripCase alerts (but these only flag changes ~3 days before departure)
- Verify flight numbers and times before each segment
- After any schedule change, confirm with AA desk that the ticket is properly reissued

**[V3]** FJ is most likely to have schedule changes (small airline, seasonal adjustments). Check FJ segments monthly in the 3 months before departure, and weekly in the final month.

### 5.3 Schedule Change Leverage

If an airline makes an involuntary schedule change to your routing, you can often get routing change fees waived. This can be leveraged:
- QR or FJ changes a flight time → request free rerouting to a different flight/date
- Consolidate desired changes with the involuntary one = one free change

### 5.4 No-Show Cancels EVERYTHING

**Never miss a segment without calling first.** A no-show on ANY flight cancels ALL remaining segments on the ticket. If you can't make a flight:
1. Call AA desk BEFORE departure time
2. Request protection on the next available flight
3. Get confirmation that remaining segments are preserved

**[V3]** Our off-ticket JFK→MCO (JetBlue) means we deliberately skip the surface sector. Since surface sectors aren't "flown," this should be fine. But verify with the booking agent that the GDS won't flag a no-show for the surface sector.

---

## 6. NTP/Tier Point Optimization on RTW

### 6.1 Marketing Carrier = Everything

The marketing carrier code on your ticket determines:
- Whether NTPs are revenue-based (BA/AA/IB) or distance-based (all others)
- The percentage rate for distance-based earning
- Bonus NTP eligibility (BA-marketed only)

| Marketing Carrier | NTP Method | D-Class Rate |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **QR, JL, AY** | Distance-based | **50% of miles** |
| **CX, FJ, QF, RJ, AS** | Distance-based | **25% of miles** |
| **BA** | Revenue-based | 1 NTP per GBP 1 eligible spend + 400 bonus |
| **AA, IB** | Revenue-based | 1 NTP per GBP 1 eligible spend |

### 6.2 Codeshare NTP Strategy

The same physical flight under different carrier codes earns dramatically different NTPs:

**Example (real-world FT data):**
- KUL-NRT under **MH code**: 30 Qpoints / 4,173 Avios
- KUL-NRT under **QR code**: 81 Qpoints / 15,418 Avios

If a segment can be booked under a higher-earning carrier's codeshare, NTP yield increases. However, on RTW tickets, codeshare selection is limited — the AA desk may not accommodate all preferences.

**[V3]** Key codeshare opportunity: dvs7310 notes that AA metal transcontinental flights (like SFO→JFK) can sometimes be booked under **JL or AY flight numbers** for better NTP earning. JL/AY D-class earns 50% of distance vs AA's revenue-based calculation. Ask the AA desk if JL or AY codeshare is available on SFO→JFK. If so, the 2,580-mile segment earns ~1,290 NTP (distance-based 50%) vs whatever the revenue-based AA calculation yields.

### 6.3 xONEx NTP Calculator

FT user aaaxton built a public calculator: **https://xonex.pages.dev**
- Works for D/AONE routes with BA/AY/IB programs
- Uses airport coordinates — expect +/- 20 TP variance from official
- Useful for planning, not definitive

---

## 7. Online Tool Warnings

The oneworld online booking tool (rtw.oneworld.com) is useful ONLY for rough pricing estimates. It should NEVER be used for actual booking.

### Known Bugs and Issues

| Issue | Impact | Workaround |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Defaults to QF ticketing | Future changes become painful | Book via AA desk instead |
| QR cannot be first carrier | Rejects valid CAI→AMM→DOH routings | Book via AA desk |
| Invents nonexistent rules | "Max 5 stopovers under 26,000 miles" (fake) | Ignore; book via desk |
| Confuses Explorer with Global Explorer | Applies 34,000nm cap to Explorer (wrong) | Ignore; Explorer has no cap |
| CAI/OSL sometimes fail to populate | Can't price ex-Cairo/Oslo | Try different browser; or call desk |
| Mileage error at ~34,000nm | Rejects valid high-mileage routings | Search economy first, switch to business |
| Shows phantom availability | Per-leg availability ≠ POS-based availability | Verify with desk |

**[V3]** Our routing is ~34,400nm — likely to trigger the fake mileage cap error. If pricing online, search economy first (LONE4), then switch to business (DONE4) to bypass the bug. Better yet, skip the tool and call the AA desk directly.

## 8. V3-Specific Optimization Checklist

### Before Booking

| # | Action | Priority | Notes |
|---|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Verify Cairo fare exists** | CRITICAL | Call AA RTW desk. Ex-CAI may no longer be priced. Backup: ex-OSL (~GBP 4,500-4,800) |
| 2 | **Confirm FJ April 2026 schedule** | CRITICAL | Call FJ +679 672 0888. Verify FJ362, FJ289, FJ870 operating days |
| 3 | **Confirm NRT→HND, TSA→TPE = same city** | CRITICAL | Agent must NOT create surface sectors for these |
| 4 | **Clarify MAD stopover vs 2-stopover limit** | HIGH | Can we have 3 EU/ME stopovers (AMM, DOH, MAD)? |
| 5 | **Check D-class on all segments** | HIGH | Book segment-by-segment, confirm D before proceeding |
| 6 | **Verify IB1903 MAD→CAI operator** | HIGH | Must be mainline IB, not Iberia Express (I2) |
| 7 | **Compare AA vs QR plating cost** | MEDIUM | QR saves ~EUR 800+ but limits change flexibility |
| 8 | **Ask about JL/AY codeshare on SFO→JFK** | LOW | Potential NTP boost |

### During Booking

| # | Action | Why |
|---|--------|-----|
| 1 | Book one segment at a time | Prevents married segments |
| 2 | Wait for D-class confirmation per segment | Don't move on until confirmed |
| 3 | Request "OSI YY OW RTW" in PNR | Required annotation for RTW |
| 4 | Emphasize NO mileage cap | System may throw Global Explorer 34,000nm error |
| 5 | Declare JFK→MCO as surface sector | Must be explicitly coded |
| 6 | Use dummy dates for far-out segments | Change later for free |
| 7 | Confirm complete itinerary after ticketing | Verify all carrier codes, dates, times |

### After Booking (Within 24 Hours)

| # | Action | Why |
|---|--------|-----|
| 1 | Verify all marketing carrier codes | AA system may auto-change codes post-ticketing |
| 2 | Confirm e-ticket number(s) received | "Without an e-ticket you have nothing" |
| 3 | Check AA.com shows correct itinerary | Cross-reference every segment |
| 4 | Save PNR and ticket numbers offline | Needed for any mid-trip changes |

### Before First Flight

| # | Action | Why |
|---|--------|-----|
| 1 | **DO NOT change first segment date** | Triggers repricing risk |
| 2 | Resolve all scheduling issues on later segments | Date changes on non-first segments are free |
| 3 | Fly CAI→AMM as planned | Locks base fare permanently |
| 4 | Reconfirm FJ schedules 30 days before each FJ flight | Small airline, seasonal changes |

### During Trip

| # | Action | Why |
|---|--------|-----|
| 1 | Check itinerary on AA.com weekly | Catch silent schedule changes |
| 2 | Have TA contact for emergencies | AA desk not 24/7; TA covers gaps |
| 3 | Never no-show without calling first | Cancels all remaining segments |
| 4 | Carry printed itinerary with all PNR/ticket numbers | Airport agents may need reference |
| 5 | Singapore: Carry printed onward FJ ticket + SG Arrival Card | Required for 96h VFTF entry |

## 9. Common Mistakes (From 60 Pages of FlyerTalk War Stories)

### The Fatal Mistakes

1. **Changing the first segment before flying it** — One user faced $6,000+ repricing. Fly it. Lock it.
2. **Booking via the online tool** — Defaults to QF ticketing. "NEVER book ex-Europe with BA! What a nightmare."
3. **Not having an e-ticket** — "Without an e-ticket you have nothing." Confirm ticket issuance within 48 hours.
4. **Missing a flight without calling** — All remaining segments cancelled. Always call before departure time.

### The Expensive Mistakes

5. **Ignoring plating carrier** — Same routing, AA vs QR plating = EUR 1,273 difference.
6. **Multiple separate change calls** — Each call triggers separate $125 fee. Consolidate all changes into one call.
7. **Departing from UK on premium long-haul** — ~GBP 250 departure tax per person. Route through a non-UK European gateway.
8. **Not comparing carrier surcharges** — Same route can differ by $1,200+ between QF and AA.

### The Frustrating Mistakes

9. **Trusting ExpertFlyer blindly** — D-class shown ≠ D-class bookable. Married segments, POS restrictions, and carrier-specific blocks are invisible.
10. **Presenting connections together to the agent** — Triggers married-segment restrictions. Feed one flight at a time.
11. **Not verifying marketing carrier codes after ticketing** — AA's system auto-changes codes within 24 hours.
12. **Confusing oneworld Explorer with Global Explorer** — Completely different products. Explorer has no mileage cap; Global Explorer has 34,000nm limit.

### The Overlooked Mistakes

13. **Forgetting surface sectors count as segments** — LGA→JFK = 1 segment wasted. Eliminate by routing through intermediate hubs.
14. **Not monitoring flights post-booking** — Airlines change schedules by minutes without notification. AA may not automatically reticket.
15. **Assuming tax refunds on changes** — Tax decreases from date changes may NOT be refunded.
16. **Expecting QR to book directly** — QR has no RTW desk. They redirect to the website. Use a TA for QR plating.

## 10. Advanced Strategies

### 10.1 The "Free Holiday" Extension

Northern hemisphere residents can extract 5-6 holidays from one ticket:
1. Main RTW loop
2. Stopovers in origin continent (2 allowed)
3. Domestic flights using spare segments
4. Southern hemisphere side trip (if second continent visit applies)

**[V3]** With 16/16 segments used and 0 spare, this strategy is maxed out. Our routing already extracts full value from the segment budget.

### 10.2 "Parking" the Ticket

If you want to split the RTW into separate trips, you can "park" the ticket at an intermediate point, go home off-ticket, and resume later (within the 1-year validity). Useful for multi-month RTW trips with work breaks.

### 10.3 Post-Departure Upgrade Requests

If D-class wasn't available at booking and you accepted economy, some carriers will reissue for free when D opens up:
- CX reissued with "NO ADC" (no additional charge) when D became available post-ticketing
- AA desk can process upgrades post-ticketing
- QF may resist but has done it under pressure

### 10.4 Eastbound vs Westbound

Dr. HFH, after "two or three RTW per year for a decade," strongly prefers **eastbound** for:
- Better flight schedules and connections

# Plating carrier comparison (total YQ impact on typical 16-segment DONE4)
plating_comparison:
  QR:
    typical_total_yq_usd: 800
    notes: "Cheapest plating. No RTW desk — must use travel agent."
    flexibility: low
  MH:
    typical_total_yq_usd: 900
    notes: "Second cheapest. Limited RTW experience."
    flexibility: low
  CX:
    typical_total_yq_usd: 1500
    notes: "Moderate. Good service."
    flexibility: medium
  AA:
    typical_total_yq_usd: 1800
    notes: "Best flexibility and service for mid-trip changes. AA RTW desk is gold standard."
    flexibility: high
  BA:
    typical_total_yq_usd: 2500
    notes: "Most expensive. Email-only changes, weeks of delays."
    flexibility: low

# Special rules
special_rules:
  aa_domestic_zero: "AA charges zero YQ on domestic US segments"
  surface_zero: "Surface sectors incur zero YQ"
  qr_nonlinear: "QR charges flat rate on first QR segment, then small incremental per additional QR segment"
  uk_departure_tax: "UK has high departure taxes for premium long-haul (~GBP 250). Fly INTO UK, depart elsewhere."

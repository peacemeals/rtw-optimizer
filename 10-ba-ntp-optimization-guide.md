## 1. System Overview

On 1 April 2025, British Airways replaced the old distance-based tier point system with a **revenue-based** system called "New Tier Points" (NTP). The key change:

- **BA, AA, IB marketed flights**: Earn **1 NTP per GBP 1 of eligible spend** (fare + carrier-imposed surcharges YQ/YR). Government taxes, airport charges excluded.
- **All other oneworld partner airlines**: Earn NTPs as a **percentage of great-circle distance flown**, varying by airline, booking class, and cabin.
- **Currency conversion**: Non-GBP fares are converted using the IATA 5-day exchange rate on the day of purchase.

The **marketing carrier** (the airline whose flight number appears on your ticket) determines which earning method applies, NOT the operating carrier.

---

## 2. Tier Thresholds

| Tier | NTP Required | Alternative Path |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Blue** | 0 (free) | -- |
| **Bronze** | 3,500 | OR 25 BA-marketed flight segments |
| **Silver** (oneworld Sapphire) | 7,500 | OR 50 BA-marketed flight segments |
| **Gold** (oneworld Emerald) | 20,000 | -- |
| **Gold Guest List (GGL)** | 65,000 (initial; at least 52,000 from BA/BA Holidays) | 40,000 to retain (at least 32,000 from BA/BA Holidays) |
| **Lifetime Gold** | 550,000 cumulative | -- |
| **Lifetime GGL** | 1,500,000 cumulative | -- |

**Collection year**: 1 April to 31 March (annual reset).

**Segment-based path**: Bronze via 25 BA-marketed segments, Silver via 50 BA-marketed segments. Only BA flight numbers count (not QR, CX, FJ, RJ etc.).

---

## 3. How NTPs Are Earned: Two Systems

### System A: Revenue-Based (BA, AA, IB marketed flights)

**Applies to**: British Airways (BA), American Airlines (AA), Iberia (IB/I2) marketed flights.

**Rate**: 1 NTP per GBP 1 of eligible spend.

**Eligible spend includes**:
- Base fare
- Carrier-Imposed Charges (YQ and YR surcharges)
- Cabin upgrades (online or at airport, BA-marketed only)
- Pre-paid seat selection (BA/IB marketed and operated only)
- Extra baggage pre-purchased (BA/IB marketed and operated only)

**Eligible spend excludes**:
- Government taxes and airport fees
- Non-airline charges

**Booking class is irrelevant** for these three airlines -- it is purely the GBP amount that matters. A cheap J fare earns fewer NTPs than an expensive D fare on the same route.

### System B: Distance-Based (All other partner airlines)

**Applies to**: QR, CX, FJ, RJ, AY, JL, QF, AS, MH, AT, UL, WY, EI, and all other oneworld/partner airlines NOT BA/AA/IB.

**Formula**: NTP = (great-circle distance in miles) x (percentage for booking class)

**No minimum NTP per segment** -- the calculation is purely mathematical. A short segment in a low booking class can earn very few NTPs (e.g., a 200-mile economy lowest flight at 2% = 4 NTPs).

**No status tier bonus**: Bronze/Silver/Gold members do NOT receive any extra NTPs on partner airline flights. The percentage is flat regardless of your tier.

---

## 4. Bonus Tier Points (Permanent from Nov 2025)

From **25 November 2025**, BA permanently awards bonus NTPs per flight segment based on cabin class. These are **automatic** with no registration required.

| Cabin | Bonus NTP per segment |
|-------|--------------------|
| Euro Traveller (short-haul economy) | 75 |
| Club Europe (short-haul business) | 175 |
| World Traveller (long-haul economy) | 150 |
| World Traveller Plus (premium economy) | 275 |
| Club World (long-haul business) | 400 |
| First | 550 |

### CRITICAL: Bonus NTP Eligibility

These bonus NTPs apply ONLY to flights with a **BA flight number** (BA-marketed). The qualifying conditions:

- Flight must be booked under a **BA code** (BA flight number in itinerary)
- Can be **operated by** BA or any partner airline (e.g., BA codeshare on QR metal)
- **Excludes**: Economy Basic fares, Reward Flights, Avios upgrades, promotional upgrades on partner-operated flights

**For a oneworld RTW ticket**: Only segments where the marketing carrier is BA (i.e., the segment has a BA flight number) would qualify for these bonuses. On a typical RTW, this means only the BA-operated segments (e.g., LHR-CAI) unless BA codeshares exist on partner-operated flights.

The bonus is based on the cabin you **paid for and fly in** -- complimentary operational upgrades do not change the bonus tier.

---

## 5. Airline-by-Airline NTP Earning Rates

### 5.1 British Airways (BA) -- Revenue-Based

**Rate**: 1 NTP per GBP 1 eligible spend + bonus NTP per segment.

BA does not use booking class percentages. The NTP earned depends entirely on ticket price (fare + YQ/YR).

**Example**: LHR-JFK return in Club World (average fare ~GBP 2,480 eligible spend):
- Base: 2,480 NTP
- Bonus: 2 x 400 = 800 NTP
- **Total: 3,280 NTP**

For your RTW: The BA segments (LHR-CAI, JFK-LHR) will earn based on the proportional fare allocated to those segments.

### 5.2 Qatar Airways (QR) -- Distance-Based

| Fare Category | Booking Classes | % of Miles |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Economy Lowest | T, O, W, G | 4% |
| Economy Low | K, M, L, V, S, N, Q | 7% |
| Economy Flexible | Y, B, H | 15% |
| Business Lowest | P | 25% |
| Business Low | R, I | 25% |
| **Business Flexible** | **J, C, D** | **50%** |
| First Low | A | 40% |
| First Flexible | F | 60% |

**RTW relevance**: DOH-NRT is ~5,183 miles. In D class (Business Flexible):
- NTP = 5,183 x 50% = **~2,592 NTP**

QR is one of the **most generous** partner airlines for NTP earning, tied with Finnair and JAL at the top tier.

### 5.3 Cathay Pacific (CX) -- Distance-Based

| Fare Category | Booking Classes | % of Miles |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Economy Lowest | K, L, M, N, Q, S, V | 2% |
| Economy Flexible | Y, B, H | 7.5% |
| Premium Economy Low | R, E | 6% |
| Premium Economy Flexible | W | 12.5% |
| **Business Low** | **I, P** | **12.5%** |
| **Business Flexible** | **J, C, D** | **25%** |
| First Low | A | 20% |
| First Flexible | F | 30% |

**RTW relevance**: HKG to NAN is not a CX route. For any CX segments (e.g., HKG domestic/regional), CX is notably **less generous** than QR -- half the rate for equivalent classes.

**IMPORTANT**: Cathay's Business Low (I, P) at 12.5% is notably poor. Only Business Flexible (J, C, D) at 25% provides meaningful NTP earning.

### 5.4 American Airlines (AA) -- Revenue-Based

**Rate**: Same as BA -- 1 NTP per GBP 1 eligible spend.

AA is treated identically to BA for NTP purposes: it is the total eligible spend (fare + YQ/YR in GBP) that matters, NOT the booking class.

**RTW relevance**: AA segments (LAX-MEX, MEX-MIA, MIA-JFK) will earn based on their proportional fare allocation. On RTW tickets, these tend to be shorter segments with lower proportional fares.

**Note**: AA booking class H (the typical oneworld RTW business class) earns the same as J -- only the fare amount matters.

### 5.5 Fiji Airways (FJ) -- Distance-Based

**International flights:**

| Fare Category | Booking Classes | % of Miles |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Economy Lowest | G, N, T, V | 2% |
| Economy Low | K, L, M, S, O, Q, W | 3.5% |
| Economy Flexible | Y, B, H | 7.5% |
| **Business Low** | **I, Z** | **12.5%** |
| **Business Flexible** | **J, C, D** | **25%** |

**Domestic flights (Fiji internal):**

| Fare Category | Booking Classes | % of Miles |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Economy Lowest | H, L, Q, Y | 2% |

**RTW relevance key segments**:

| Segment | Distance (mi) | Class D (25%) | Class I/Z (12.5%) |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| HKG-NAN | ~4,900 | ~1,225 NTP | ~613 NTP |
| NAN-FUN (Tuvalu) | ~700 | ~175 NTP | ~88 NTP |
| FUN-NAN | ~700 | ~175 NTP | ~88 NTP |
| NAN-LAX | ~5,530 | **~1,383 NTP** | ~691 NTP |
| NAN-HNL | ~2,780 | ~695 NTP | ~348 NTP |

**CRITICAL NOTE**: The RTW oneworld Explorer ticket books in **D class** for business, which falls under Business Flexible (25%) -- NOT Business Low (12.5%). This is extremely important for NTP optimization.

FJ has **no First Class** tier, so the maximum is Business Flexible at 25%.

### 5.6 Royal Jordanian (RJ) -- Distance-Based

| Fare Category | Booking Classes | % of Miles |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Economy Lowest | H, K, L, M, N, O, Q, V, W, S | 2% |
| Economy Flexible | Y, B | 7.5% |
| **Business Low** | **I, Z** | **12.5%** |
| **Business Flexible** | **J, C, D** | **25%** |

**RTW relevance**: CAI-AMM is ~260 miles. In D class:
- NTP = 260 x 25% = **~65 NTP**

RJ is a **short segment** in the routing, so regardless of the percentage, NTP earning will be modest.

### 5.7 Iberia (IB) -- Revenue-Based

**Rate**: Same as BA/AA -- 1 NTP per GBP 1 eligible spend.

**Included**: Iberia (IB), Iberia Express (I2), Iberia Regional Air Nostrum.
**Excluded**: Flights operated by Level on behalf of Iberia.

If considering a MEX-MAD alternative, IB would earn revenue-based NTPs. The eligible spend would be the fare + YQ/YR for that segment.

### 5.8 Other Noteworthy Airlines (for reference)

**Finnair (AY) and Japan Airlines (JL)** -- Top tier, same as QR:
- Business Flexible (J, C, D): **50%** of miles
- Business Low (R, I): 25%
- Economy Flexible (Y, B, H): 15%

**Qantas (QF)** -- Same tier as CX:
- Business Flexible (J, C, D): 25%
- Business Low (I): 12.5%

**Alaska Airlines (AS)** -- Lower tier:
- Business Flexible (J, C, D): 25%
- Business Lowest (I): 12.5%

## 6. RTW Ticket-Specific Rules

### 6.1 How Fare Is Allocated

On a oneworld RTW ticket, the total fare is not simply divided equally among segments. BA uses **proportionate spend allocation** based on the relative value of each flight segment. For BA/AA/IB segments, the proportional fare determines the NTP earning. For other carriers, it defaults to the distance-based formula.

### 6.2 Marketing Carrier Determines Earning Method

On an RTW ticket, each segment has a marketing carrier:
- Segments with **BA, AA, or IB** flight numbers: Revenue-based (1 NTP per GBP 1)
- Segments with **any other airline** flight number (QR, CX, FJ, RJ, etc.): Distance-based (percentage of miles)

**On a typical RTW, each segment flies under its own carrier code** (QR for Qatar, CX for Cathay, FJ for Fiji, etc.), so most segments will use the distance-based system.

### 6.3 Issuing Carrier Matters

The airline that **issues** (tickets) the RTW affects how NTPs are calculated:

- **BA-issued RTW**: BA can see the fare breakdown; BA/AA/IB segments earn based on eligible spend as shown in Manage My Booking.
- **AA-issued RTW**: AA uses proportionate spend data that is communicated to BA for BA/AA/IB segments.
- **Other carrier-issued RTW** (e.g., JAL, QR): If fare data is NOT shared with BA, the system may default to distance-based calculations even for BA segments. One FlyerTalk data point showed a BA segment on a JAL-issued RTW earning NTPs based on GBP 164.67 proportional spend for MAD-LHR.

**Recommendation for your DONE4 RTW**: Issue through BA or AA to ensure transparent fare allocation for the BA/AA/IB segments. BA-issued is likely optimal since BA can directly see its own fare breakdown.

### 6.4 Codeshare vs Own-Code Flights

On an RTW ticket, flights typically operate under their own code (not codeshares). This means:
- QR DOH-NRT: Marketed by QR -> distance-based
- BA LHR-CAI: Marketed by BA -> revenue-based
- AA LAX-MEX: Marketed by AA -> revenue-based

If a segment were booked as a BA codeshare on QR metal (e.g., BA code on a QR-operated flight), it would earn revenue-based AND qualify for bonus NTPs. However, on RTW tickets, codeshare opportunities are typically limited.

### 6.5 Surface Sectors

Surface sectors (non-flown connections) earn **zero NTPs**. They are not flights and have no eligible spend or distance.

### 6.6 Bonus NTP on RTW Tickets

The bonus NTP (75-550 per segment depending on cabin) applies ONLY to BA-marketed segments. On a typical RTW:
- BA LHR-CAI: Would earn **400 bonus NTP** (Club World) or 550 (First)
- BA JFK-LHR: Would earn **400 bonus NTP** (Club World)
- All other carrier segments: **No bonus NTP**

### 6.7 YQ/Fuel Surcharges on RTW Tickets

YQ/YR surcharges are embedded in the RTW fare and count toward eligible spend for BA/AA/IB segments. For partner airlines using distance-based earning, YQ is irrelevant -- only miles flown and booking class matter.

DONE4 RTW tickets have surcharges baked into the fare, so you cannot separately identify the YQ component. For BA/AA/IB segments, the full proportional fare (including embedded YQ) becomes the eligible spend.

## 7. NTP Estimate for V2 Routing

### V2 Routing: CAI-AMM-DOH-NRT-HKG-NAN-FUN-NAN-LAX-MEX-MIA-JFK-LHR-CAI

Assumptions:
- Booking class D throughout (Business Flexible)
- BA-issued ticket, fare ~GBP 4,000/person
- Distances are approximate great-circle miles

| # | Segment | Carrier | Miles | Method | NTP Estimate |
|---|---------|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | CAI-AMM | RJ | 260 | Distance 25% | ~65 |
| 2 | AMM-DOH | QR | 870 | Distance 50% | ~435 |
| 3 | DOH-NRT | QR | 5,183 | Distance 50% | **~2,592** |
| 4 | NRT-HKG | CX | 1,790 | Distance 25% | ~448 |
| 5 | HKG-NAN | FJ | 4,900 | Distance 25% | **~1,225** |
| 6 | NAN-FUN | FJ | 700 | Distance 25% | ~175 |
| 7 | FUN-NAN | FJ | 700 | Distance 25% | ~175 |
| 8 | NAN-LAX | FJ | 5,530 | Distance 25% | **~1,383** |
| 9 | LAX-MEX | AA | ~1,550 | Revenue-based | TBD* |
| 10 | MEX-MIA | AA | ~1,280 | Revenue-based | TBD* |
| 11 | MIA-JFK | AA | ~1,090 | Revenue-based | TBD* |
| 12 | JFK-LHR | BA | 3,460 | Revenue-based | TBD** |
| 13 | LHR-CAI | BA | 2,190 | Revenue-based | TBD** |

**Distance-based total (segments 1-8)**: ~6,498 NTP

**Revenue-based segments (9-13)**: Depends on proportional fare allocation. If ~GBP 4,000 total fare is split roughly equally, and ~40% is allocated to the 5 revenue-based segments (AA+BA), that would be ~GBP 1,600 = ~1,600 NTP base + bonus NTPs on BA segments.

**Bonus NTP on BA segments**: JFK-LHR (400) + LHR-CAI (400) = **800 NTP** (assuming Club World)

### Rough Total Estimate: ~8,900 - 9,500 NTP per person

This would comfortably achieve **Silver (7,500)** and approach but likely not reach **Gold (20,000)**.

*Note: Revenue-based estimates are highly uncertain as fare allocation methodology is not publicly documented in detail.*

## 8. Optimization Strategies

### 8.1 Maximize Distance-Based Segments

For partner airlines, longer distances = more NTPs. The V2 routing already optimizes this with:
- QR DOH-NRT (5,183 mi at 50%): The single most valuable NTP segment
- FJ NAN-LAX (5,530 mi at 25%): Second most valuable
- FJ HKG-NAN (4,900 mi at 25%): Third most valuable

### 8.2 QR Is Your Most NTP-Efficient Airline

Qatar Airways earns **50% of distance** in D class vs. only 25% for FJ, CX, and RJ. Every mile on QR is worth double what it is on CX or FJ.

**If NTP maximization is a priority**, consider whether any routing changes could add more QR mileage:
- AMM-DOH at 870 miles x 50% = 435 NTP (already included)
- DOH-NRT at 5,183 miles x 50% = 2,592 NTP (already included)
- A hypothetical QR DOH-HKG (3,280 mi x 50% = 1,640) instead of direct NRT-HKG on CX would earn more, but routing constraints and the Art Basel HK timing make this difficult.

### 8.3 CX Earns Poorly -- Minimize CX Mileage

CX at 25% in D class is half of QR's 50%. The NRT-HKG segment on CX (1,790 mi x 25% = 448) is unavoidable given the routing, but avoid adding extra CX segments if NTP is a concern.

### 8.4 Booking Class Matters Enormously for Partners

The difference between Business Low and Business Flexible is often 2x:
- FJ D class: 25% vs FJ I class: 12.5%
- QR D class: 50% vs QR I class: 25%
- CX D class: 25% vs CX I class: 12.5%

**Ensure the RTW ticket books in D class throughout** (which oneworld Explorer DONE4 typically does for business class).

### 8.5 The V1 vs V2 NTP Comparison

| Route Change | V1 NTP | V2 NTP | Difference |
|-------------|--------|--------|------------|
| NAN-HNL (FJ, 2,780mi, 25%) | ~695 | -- | -695 |
| HNL-DFW (AA, revenue-based) | ~TBD | -- | -TBD |
| NAN-LAX (FJ, 5,530mi, 25%) | -- | ~1,383 | +1,383 |

V2 likely earns **more distance-based NTP** because NAN-LAX (5,530 mi) replaces NAN-HNL (2,780 mi), and the HNL-DFW AA segment would have earned revenue-based NTP which is typically less generous on RTW fare allocations.

### 8.6 Singapore Add-On NTP Impact

If adding HKG-SIN-NAN via Singapore (+1 segment):
- CX HKG-SIN: ~1,600 mi x 25% = ~400 NTP
- FJ SIN-NAN: ~4,400 mi x 25% = ~1,100 NTP
- **vs** FJ HKG-NAN direct: ~4,900 mi x 25% = ~1,225 NTP

Singapore detour total: ~1,500 NTP vs direct ~1,225 NTP = **+275 NTP gain** (modest). The NTP benefit is marginal; the Singapore add is better justified by the destination itself.

### 8.7 Consider IB MEX-MAD Alternative

If replacing AA MEX-MIA-JFK-BA LHR with IB MEX-MAD-BA LHR:
- IB earns revenue-based (same as AA/BA), so the NTP method doesn't change
- MAD-LHR on BA would earn revenue-based + 175 bonus NTP (Club Europe)
- The NTP impact would depend entirely on fare allocation -- likely similar total

### 8.8 Partner Airline Tier Groupings (NTP Generosity Ranking)

**Tier 1 (Most Generous -- 50% in D class)**:
- Qatar Airways (QR)
- Finnair (AY)
- Japan Airlines (JL)
- Aer Lingus (EI)

**Tier 2 (25% in D class)**:
- Fiji Airways (FJ)
- Cathay Pacific (CX)
- Royal Jordanian (RJ)
- Qantas (QF)
- Alaska Airlines (AS)
- Royal Air Maroc (AT)
- Malaysia Airlines (MH)
- SriLankan Airlines (UL)
- Oman Air (WY)

**Revenue-Based (varies by fare)**:
- British Airways (BA)
- American Airlines (AA)
- Iberia (IB)
